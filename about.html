                            <h3>About</h3><br>
                            <p>Scott Wood is a fifth-generation lifelong resident of Haverhill, where he was elected in 2003 to the Haverhill School Committee just two years after graduating from Haverhill High School. He holds the distinction of being Haverhill’s youngest-ever elected official. A two-time past president of the School Committee and its current vice-president, Scott has served the city and its schools for almost 14 years.</p><br>
                            
                            <p>Scott is a current member of the Haverhill School Committee and serving his 4th term. He was elected back in 2003 becoming the youngest elected official in Haverhill's history. Scott serves as a member of the Whittier Vo-Tech School Committee and on the Board of Directors at The Greater Haverhill Boys and Girls Club. Scott also is actively involved in fundraising and charity work serving as a member of the National Parkinon's Disease Foundation Boston planning committee and grant award committee.</p><br>
                            
                            <p>Some of Scott’s many notable accomplishments and priorities on behalf of Haverhill schools and its students in the last decade have included fighting for smaller class sizes and modern technology in the classroom, supporting major projects such as the comprehensive high school renovation and the new Hunking School, and successfully negotiating contracts that balance fiscal restraint with the need for competitive pay to attract and retain quality teachers. He has also been a leader in calling attention to the terrible opioid crisis and demanding new and innovative programs in our schools and community to address drug and alcohol abuse.</p><br>
                            
                            <p>Scott attended Fox School, Golden Hill School, Whittier Middle School and Haverhill High School, where he graduated in 2001. He went on to graduate from Fisher College with two degrees: Bachelors in Management and an Associate’s Degree in Criminal Justice. Scott is currently pursuing his MBA at Fitchburg State University.</p><br>                  
                            
                            <p>Scott is the son of Scott Wood Sr. and Cheryl (Howard) Wood; he has one younger sister, Christy.</p>
